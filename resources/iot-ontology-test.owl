Kaleida Healths policy is to not disclose protected health information about Behavioral Health patients except as permitted or required by law. Family and Friends Involved In Your Care. If you do not object, Kaleida Health may share your health information with a family member, relative, or close personal friend who is involved in your care or payment for that care. We may also notify a family member, personal representative or another person responsible for your care about your location and general condition here at the hospital, or about the unfortunate event of your death. In some cases, Kaleida Health may need to share your information with a disaster relief organization that will help us notify these persons. Behavioral Health patients will be given the opportunity to object each time before information about them is released to family and friends. This will apply whether or not consent was authorized at time of admission in the Kaleida Health Consent for Treatment or Payment Agreement. 3. Emergencies Or Public Need Kaleida Health may use your health information, and share it with others, in order to treat you in an emergency or to meet important public needs. Kaleida Health will not be required to obtain your general written consent before using or disclosing your information for these reasons. Kaleida Health will, however, obtain your written authorization for, or provide you with an opportunity to object to, the use and disclosure of your health information in these situations when state law specifically requires that we do so. Emergencies. Kaleida Health may use or disclose your health information if you need emergency treatment or if we are required by law to treat you but are unable to obtain your general written consent. If this happens, Kaleida Health will try to obtain your general written consent as soon as we reasonably can after we treat you. Communication Barriers. Kaleida Health may use and disclose your health information if we are unable to obtain your general written consent because of substantial communication barriers, and we believe you would want us to treat you if we could communicate with you. As Required By Law. Kaleida Health may use or disclose your health information if we are required by law to do so. Kaleida Health also will notify you of these uses and disclosures if notice is required by law. Public Health Activities. Kaleida Health may disclose your health information to authorized public health officials (or a foreign government agency collaborating with such officials) so they may carry out their public health activities. For example, we may share your health information with government officials who are responsible for controlling disease, injury or disability. Kaleida Health may also disclose your health information to a person who may have been exposed to a communicable disease or be at risk for contracting or spreading the disease if a law permits us to do so. And finally, Kaleida Health may release some health information about you to your employer if your employer hires us to provide you with a physical exam and we discover that you have a work-related injury or disease that your employer must know about in order to comply with employment laws. Victims Of Abuse, Neglect Or Domestic Violence. Kaleida Health may release your health information to a public health authority that is authorized to receive reports of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. For example, we may report your information to government officials if we reasonably believe that you have been a victim of such abuse, neglect or domestic violence. Kaleida Health will make every effort to obtain your permission before releasing this information, but in some cases we may be required or authorized to act without your permission. Health Oversight Activities. Kaleida Health may release your health information to government agencies authorized to conduct audits, investigations, and inspections of our facility.

To Avert A Serious And Imminent Threat To Health Or Safety. Kaleida Health may use your health information or share it with others when necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to your health or safety, or the health or safety of another person or the public. In such cases, we will only share your information with someone able to help prevent the threat. Kaleida Health may also disclose your health information to law enforcement officers if you tell us that you participated in a violent crime that may have caused serious physical harm to another person (unless you admitted that fact while in counseling), or if we determine that you escaped from lawful custody. National Security And Intelligence Activities Or Protective Services. Kaleida Health may disclose your health information to authorized federal officials who are conducting national security and intelligence activities or providing protective services to the President of the United States or other important officials. Military And Veterans.

Kaleida Health may also release this information to funeral directors as necessary to carry out their duties. Organ And Tissue Donation. In the unfortunate event of your death, Kaleida Health may disclose your health information to organizations that procure or store organs, eyes or other tissues so that these organizations may investigate whether donation or transplantation is possible under applicable laws. Research. As appropriate, Kaleida Health will ask for your written authorization before using your health information or sharing it with others in order to conduct research. However, under some circumstances, Kaleida Health may use and disclose your health information without your written authorization if we obtain approval through a special process to ensure that research without your written authorization poses minimal risk to your privacy. Kaleida Health may also release your health information without your written authorization to people who are preparing a future research project. In the unfortunate event of your death, we may share your health information with people who are conducting research using the information of deceased persons. 4. Completely De-identified Or Partially De-identified Information. Kaleida Health may use and disclose your health information if we have removed any information that has the potential to identify you so that the health information is completely de-identified. Kaleida Health may also use and disclose partially de-identified health information about you if the person who will receive the information signs an agreement to protect the privacy of the information as required by federal and state law. Partially de-identified health information will not contain any information that would directly identify you (such as your name, street address, social security number, phone number, fax number, electronic mail address, website address, or license number).

For Bing Search in your browser, using the search terms you enter and the results you click, search history provides an easy way to revisit the sites and searches youve used before. You may clear your search history from appearing on the site by following the steps provided here or by going to the Bing preferences page noted above. Clearing your history removes it from the Search History service and prevents that history from being displayed on the site, but does not delete information from our standard search logs, which are retained and anonymized as described in the Collecting Your Information Section.
