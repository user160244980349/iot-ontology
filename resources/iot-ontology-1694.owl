We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. Security lies in your hands as well. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. What is phishing- Phishing is a scam where fraudsters pretend that they represent well-known companies to steal your personal information. If you receive an email claiming to be from Hat World that asks you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email. "^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .
