By using our site and products, you give us explicit consent to place cookies and other tracking technology on your computer or mobile device. Pixel tags: We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad). Mobile Device IDs: If youre using an app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our apps. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted. Ad companies use device IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage. Do Not Track Disclosure Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI Consumer Opt-out link and the DAA opt-out link above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. Apps If you install one of our apps on your mobile device, your use of the app is subject to our app license agreement, {removed hyperref}. html. Childrens privacy We do allow children under 13 to register for an account, but we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. Personally identifiable information, for example, includes a first and last name; a home or other physical address; an e-mail address; a telephone number; or a social security number. When we have identified through our age-screening process that a child under 13 is trying to register an account with us, we immediately hash that users e-mail into a nonreversible character string and discard the e-mail. Then the users e-mail address is only used for password recovery purposes. Generally speaking, one-way hashing is a way to anonymize or hide data by transforming pieces of information into fixed strings of alphanumeric characters. For example, when the e-mail address {removed hyperref} is hashed, the result or hash value might be a8der13ap69. Every time that hash function is applied to that e-mail address the result will be the same. It is called one-way hashing because the function allows you to convert the data only one way. So while it is possible to convert an e-mail address into a hash value, it is not possible to convert that value back into the e-mail address. When a child under the age of 13 registers for an account, we use hashing to create a password reminder system that does not require us to retain that childs email address. To do this, we apply the hash function to the email address and associate the resulting hash value (not the e-mail) with the users account. The e-mail address is immediately discarded after the hash function is applied. When the user forgets the password associated with the account, we request the original email address, hash it, and then compare the two hash values. If they match, we e-mail the password reminder to the user and then immediately discard the e-mail again. "^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .
